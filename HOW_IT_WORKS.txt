HEIDI'S ADVENTURE GAME - HOW IT WORKS (Beginner-Friendly)
================================================================================

This game is written in simple Python for beginners.

✨ GOOD NEWS: The code now has EXTREMELY detailed comments!
   Every single line is explained so you can learn as you read.
   Open heidi_adventure.py and you'll see comments explaining everything!

HOW THE CODE WORCTIONS:

1. VARIABLE TO TRACK SCENE:
   current_scene = "start"
   - This keeps track of which part of the story we're in

2. FUNCTIONS FOR EACH SCENE:
   - Each scene has its own function (like show_start(), show_scene_1(), etc.)
   - Functions are like small programs that do one job

3. BUTTON CLICKS:
   - When you click a button, it calls a function
   - For example: command=show_stay_alps means "when clicked, run show_stay_alps()"

4. CLEAR AND SHOW:
   - clear_window() removes all widgets (buttons, labels) from the screen
   - Then the new scene shows new widgets

THE STORY STRUCTURE (from stry.txt):

Scene 1: The Beginning
- Two choices:
  * Stay in Alps → Path 1
  * Travel to Frankfurt → Path 2

Path 1 - Stay in Alps:
- Grandfather gets sick
- Two choices:
  * Go for help → Ending A (Heidi the Brave)
  * Stay home → Ending B (Heidi the Heart)

Path 2 - Travel to Frankfurt:
- Clara asks her to stay
- Two choices:
  * Stay in Frankfurt → Ending C (Heidi the Writer)
  * Return home → Ending D (Heidi the Dreamer)

CODING CONCEPTS USED:

✅ Variables (current_scene)
✅ Functions (def show_start())
✅ If/else (built into button commands - each button leads to different function)
✅ Tkinter widgets (Label, Button, Canvas)
✅ Event handling (command= when buttons are clicked)

WHAT EACH FUNCTION DOES:

1. show_start() - Shows the title screen with "Sponsored by RunMyModel.org"
2. show_scene_1() - Shows the first story scene
3. show_stay_alps() - Path when Heidi stays in Alps
4. show_travel_frankfurt() - Path when Heidi travels to Frankfurt
5. show_ending_brave() - Ending A
6. show_ending_heart() - Ending B  
7. show_ending_writer() - Ending C
8. show_ending_dreamer() - Ending D
9. clear_window() - Clears the screen to show new content

FLOW OF THE GAME:

Start → Button Click → Function Runs → New Screen Shows → 
Button Click → Function Runs → Ending Shows → Restart Button

EACH BUTTON:
- Has a label (the text you see)
- Has a command (which function to run when clicked)
- Has styling (colors, fonts, size)

TO RUN THE GAME:
python heidi_adventure.py
