# IMPORT STATEMENTS - Getting tools from Python's library
# ============================================================================

import tkinter as tk
# tkinter = Python's built-in library for making GUI windows
# tk is just a shorter name for tkinter
# Now we can use tk.Label, tk.Button, etc.

from tkinter import font
# We need font to create custom text styles (bold, different sizes, etc.)

# ============================================================================
# VARIABLES - Storing information
# ============================================================================

# This variable tracks which scene we're currently showing to the player
# We'll update it as the player makes choices
current_scene = "start"
# "start" means the beginning screen
# We could also use "scene_1", "stay_alps", "ending_brave", etc.

# ============================================================================
# CREATING THE MAIN WINDOW
# ============================================================================

# tk.Tk() creates the main window

# window is a variable that holds our main window

# Set the title that appears at the top of the window
window.title("Heidi's Adventure - Sponsored by RunMyModel.org")

# Set the window size to 800 pixels wide, 600 pixels tall
window.geometry("800x600")

# Set the background color
# "#2c4a3e" is a dark green color (in hexadecimal format)
window.configure(bg="#2c4a3e")

# ============================================================================
# CREATING FONTS (Text styles)
# ============================================================================

# Create a big bold font for titles

    size=28,          # Font size in points

)

# Create a medium font for story text
medium_font = font.Font(
    family="Arial",    # Same font family
    size=16            # Smaller than big_font

# window.mainloop() is CRITICAL - it keeps the window open
# Without this, the window would appear and disappear instantly
# mainloop() tells Python: "Keep the window open and listen for events"
# Events include: button clicks, mouse movements, keyboard presses, etc.
window.mainloop()

# This line will only run when the user closes the window
# Because mainloop() keeps the program running until the window is closed
